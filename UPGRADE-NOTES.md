# Upgrade notes

When you upgrade your Mattermost containers, please check at those upgrade notes for some breaking changes.

## Upgrading Mattermost to 6.0+

Starting with Mattermost `6.0` :
- we stopped to support the `web` Docker image (you can find more information about it on [#245](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-docker/issues/245))
- we stopped to maintain a "too generic" `docker-compose.yml` file

If you were not using the `web` image and the `docker-compose.yml` file provided in this repository, nothing changed for you.  

If you used the `web` image or the `docker-compose.yml` file, we invite you to setup your own reverse proxy and to write your own Docker Compose file. A good starting point is to look at the [Traefik deployment example](contrib/traefik/README.md) that is close to the previous Docker Compose file and support TLS. **Please backup your existing volumes, data and configuration** before the migration, in this example the path to Docker bind mounts changed. Ensure you move all your data (with correct access rights) to the right folders.

## Upgrading Mattermost to 4.9+

Docker images for `4.9.0` release introduce some important changes from [PR #241](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-docker/pull/241) to improve production use of Mattermost with Docker.
**There are 2 important changes for existing installations**

One important change is that we don't use `root` user by default to run the Mattermost application. So, as explained on [the README](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-docker#start), if you use host mounted volume you have to be sure that files on your host server have the correct UID/GID (by default those values are `2000`). In practice, you should just run following commands :
```
mkdir -p ./volumes/app/mattermost/{data,logs,config,plugins}
chown -R 2000:2000 ./volumes/app/mattermost/
```

The second important change is the port used by Mattermost application container. The default port is now `8000`, and existing installations that use port `80` will not work without a little configuration change. You have to open your Mattermost configuration file (`./volumes/app/mattermost/config/config.json` by default) and change the key `ServiceSettings.ListenAddress` to `:8000`.
Also if you use your own web-server/reverse-proxy you need to change its configuration to reach port `8000` of the Mattermost container.


## Upgrading to Team Edition 3.0.x from 2.x

You need to migrate your database before upgrading Mattermost to `3.0.x` from
`2.x`. Run these commands in the latest `mattermost-docker` directory.
```
docker-compose rm -f app
docker-compose build app
docker-compose run app -upgrade_db_30
docker-compose up -d
```
See the [offical Upgrade Guide](http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html) for more details.
